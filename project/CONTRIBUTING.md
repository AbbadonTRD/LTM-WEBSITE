# Development Workflow

## Environment Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing TypeScript and React conventions
- Use functional components and hooks
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Keep components focused and modular

### Component Structure
- Place new components in `src/components/`
- Group related components in subdirectories
- Include appropriate TypeScript interfaces
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic

### Testing
Before submitting changes:
1. Run development server and test locally
2. Check console for warnings/errors
3. Test responsive design
4. Verify all features work as expected

### Performance
- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size
- Use React.memo() for expensive renders

### Accessibility
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain good color contrast
- Test with screen readers

## Deployment Process

1. Build locally first:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Test production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. Deploy to staging/production:
   - Staging deployments are automatic
   - Production requires manual approval

## Monitoring

After deployment:
1. Check application loads correctly
2. Verify all features work
3. Monitor for console errors
4. Check performance metrics
